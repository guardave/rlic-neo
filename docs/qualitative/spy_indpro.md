# Industrial Production Index (INDPRO)

## What is the Industrial Production Index?

The Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) measures the real output of all relevant establishments
located in the United States for manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. Published
monthly by the Federal Reserve Board since 1919.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Coincident Indicator**: Moves with the business cycle, not ahead of it
- **Coverage**: ~20% of the U.S. economy (manufacturing-focused)
- **Release Timing**: Mid-month, approximately 15 days after the reference month
- **Revisions**: Subject to revisions for 3-4 months after initial release

## Role in Recession Dating

The NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee considers Industrial Production as one of the
**"Big Four"** recession indicators:

1. Real Personal Income (less transfers)
2. Nonfarm Payroll Employment
3. Real Personal Consumption Expenditures
4. **Industrial Production**

According to the Fed's recession risk analysis, these indicators are combined into coincident
economic indexes to identify business cycle turning points.

## How Investors Use Industrial Production

1. **Economic Health Barometer**: Rising IP signals expansion; falling IP signals contraction
2. **Capacity Utilization Context**: IP is released alongside capacity utilization
3. **Sector Analysis**: Breakdown by industry provides manufacturing insights
4. **Leading vs Coincident**: IP itself is coincident, but rate of change can provide warnings

## Academic Research on IP and Stock Returns

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| IP is coincident, not leading | NBER, Fed | Cannot predict stock returns directly |
| Stock returns lead IP | International research | Markets anticipate production changes |
| Relationship unstable over time | Stock & Watson (1998) | Historical patterns may not persist |
| IP reacts quickly to business cycle | Chicago Fed | Useful for confirming regime changes |
| "Big Four" indicator for recessions | Advisor Perspectives | Critical for identifying economic downturns |

## Key Literature References

- **Fama (1981)** - "Stock Returns, Real Activity, Inflation, and Money" established foundational
  work on the relationship between stock returns and real economic activity
- **Balvers, Cosimano and McDonald (1990)** - Examined whether stock returns can be predicted
  by forecasts of industrial output
- **Hong et al.** - Found that industry portfolios can lead the market by up to two months
- **Stock and Watson (1998)** - Reported that the relationship between stock returns and
  production growth has not remained stable over time

## Limitations as a Stock Market Indicator

1. **Coincident Nature**: By the time IP declines, stocks have often already priced in weakness
2. **Sector Concentration**: Manufacturing is <20% of GDP; services dominate the modern economy
3. **Data Revisions**: Initial releases are often revised, creating noise for trading decisions
4. **Global Supply Chains**: U.S. production increasingly disconnected from U.S. corporate profits
