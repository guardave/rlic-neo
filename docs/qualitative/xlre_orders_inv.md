# Orders/Inventories Ratio

## What is the Orders/Inventories Ratio?

The Orders/Inventories Ratio measures the relationship between new manufacturing orders and
existing inventory levels. Derived from the Census Bureau's Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories,
and Orders (M3) survey.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Formula**: New Orders / Total Inventories
- **Interpretation**: A rising ratio indicates demand is outpacing inventory (economic strength)
- **Release Timing**: Published monthly by the Census Bureau
- **Leading Property**: Changes in the ratio often precede broader economic shifts

## Economic Signal Interpretation

| Ratio Direction | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Rising | Strong demand, lean inventories, economic expansion |
| Falling | Weakening demand, inventory buildup, potential contraction |
| High Level | Manufacturing capacity stretched, potential supply constraints |
| Low Level | Excess inventory, demand weakness |

## Role as a Leading Indicator

According to Advisor Perspectives, the Orders/Inventories ratio is closely watched as part
of the manufacturing sector's leading indicators:

> *"Inventory levels are viewed as one of several key leading economic indicators. High
inventory levels signal a degree of short-term and long-term market confidence."*

The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index incorporates manufacturing orders data, noting
that up to nine months in advance their index "does the best at signaling coming recessions."

## Why Real Estate is Sensitive to Manufacturing Indicators

| Factor | Explanation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Interest Rate Sensitivity | Manufacturing strength leads the Fed to maintain/raise rates, while weakness prompts rate cuts—directly impacting REIT valuations | Invesco Research |
| Economic Cycle Positioning | Demand for commercial real estate is closely tied to the macroeconomic cycle. Best REIT returns generated in early cycle. | Nareit |
| Leading Indicator Properties | Listed REITs anticipate moves in direct real estate by 6-9 months. XLRE reacts quickly to economic signals. | Cohen & Steers |

## Key Insights from Literature

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Manufacturing indicators lead economic cycle | Conference Board | O/I ratio provides early warning |
| REITs outperform in rate-cutting environments | Invesco | Falling O/I may signal rate cuts beneficial to REITs |
| Listed REITs lead direct real estate by 6-9 months | Cohen & Steers | XLRE reacts quickly to economic signals |
| Inventory buildup precedes recessions | Rosenberg Research | Falling O/I ratio is bearish |
| Best REIT returns in early cycle | Nareit | O/I regime helps identify cycle position |

## Limitations as a REIT Indicator

1. **Sector Specificity**: Manufacturing is <20% of GDP; services dominate modern economy
2. **Data Revisions**: Initial releases are often revised
3. **Global Supply Chains**: U.S. manufacturing increasingly disconnected from domestic real estate demand
4. **Short XLRE History**: XLRE launched in 2015, limiting historical validation
5. **COVID Distortions**: 2020-2022 created unprecedented volatility
