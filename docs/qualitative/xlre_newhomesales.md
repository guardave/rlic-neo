# XLRE vs New Home Sales (HSN1F)

## What is New Home Sales?

**New Home Sales** (FRED: HSN1F) measures the number of newly constructed homes sold each month.
Published monthly by the U.S. Census Bureau.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Forward-Looking**: New home sales require mortgage applications, credit checks, and planning
- **Construction Pipeline**: Sales drive future construction activity and employment
- **Consumer Confidence**: Major financial decisions reflecting consumer outlook
- **Release Timing**: ~3 weeks after the reference month

## Economic Signal Interpretation

| Signal | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Rising YoY | Healthy housing demand, economic strength |
| Falling YoY | Weakening housing market, potential slowdown |
| Strong Positive | Construction boom ahead |
| Strong Negative | Recession warning signal |

## Why +8 Month Lead?

**Our Analysis Found**: New Home Sales from 8 months ago predicts XLRE returns.

**Why This Timing Makes Sense:**
1. Home sales reflect buyer decisions from 3-6 months prior
2. Construction activity follows sales by 6-12 months
3. REIT revenue impacts show with multi-quarter delay
4. Market may take time to fully price in housing trends

## Key Finding: Significant at Lag +8

::: success
**POSITIVE RESULT**: r = 0.223, p = 0.025 at lag +8 months

This means New Home Sales data from 8 months ago has predictive power for XLRE returns.
The concurrent correlation (lag=0) is only r=0.06, demonstrating why **extended lead-lag
analysis is critical** - the SOP fast-fail at lag=0 would have missed this relationship.

## Why XLRE, Not Individual REITs?

**XLRE Composition:**
- Dominated by commercial REITs (office, retail, industrial)
- NOT homebuilders or residential construction
- Still sensitive to housing market via:
  - Interest rate environment
  - Consumer wealth effects
  - Economic cycle positioning

**Implication**: The relationship is indirect (housing -> economy -> REITs),
which explains the 8-month lag rather than a more direct immediate effect.

## Trading Strategy Implication

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Signal | New Home Sales YoY change (from 8 months ago) |
| Lag | +8 months |
| Direction | Rising NHS -> Positive XLRE returns expected |
| Statistical Significance | p = 0.025 (significant at 5% level) |

## Limitations

1. **Short XLRE History**: Only ~109 months of data (XLRE launched October 2015)
2. **Indirect Relationship**: Housing affects REITs through multiple channels
3. **COVID Distortions**: 2020-2022 created unprecedented housing volatility
4. **Composition Mismatch**: XLRE is commercial REITs, not residential builders
5. **Single Significant Lag**: Only lag +8 is significant; others are marginal
