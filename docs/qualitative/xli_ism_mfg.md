# XLI vs ISM Manufacturing PMI (NAPM)

## What is ISM Manufacturing PMI?

The **ISM Manufacturing PMI** (Purchasing Managers' Index) is a monthly survey of 300+ manufacturing
purchasing managers conducted by the Institute for Supply Management. Published on the **1st business
day** of each month, making it one of the earliest economic releases.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Diffusion Index**: PMI > 50 = expansion, PMI = 50 = no change, PMI < 50 = contraction
- **Sub-components**: New Orders, Production, Employment, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories
- **Leading Property**: Survey data captures real-time sentiment before hard production data
- **History**: Available since 1948, one of the longest-running economic surveys

## Economic Signal Interpretation

| PMI Level | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Above 50 | Manufacturing sector expanding |
| Below 50 | Manufacturing sector contracting |
| Above 55 | Strong expansion, capacity pressure building |
| Below 45 | Severe contraction, recession risk elevated |

## Why XLI (Industrials)?

**XLI Composition:** Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, GE Aerospace, Union Pacific,
Lockheed Martin, RTX, Deere & Co.

**Direct Link**: XLI holdings ARE the manufacturers being surveyed by ISM.
When purchasing managers report expansion, XLI companies are seeing stronger orders.

**Timing Advantage**: PMI is released before industrial production data (INDPRO),
giving an earlier signal about manufacturing health.

## Key Research Finding: Confirmatory, Not Predictive

::: warning
**Our Analysis Found**: ISM Manufacturing PMI does NOT predict XLI returns. All significant
correlations are at **negative lags** (best: lag -4, r=0.241, p<0.0001), meaning the stock
market moves FIRST and ISM PMI confirms later.

**However**, the PMI > 50 regime segmentation IS meaningful:
- **Expansion** (PMI > 50): Mean return +1.34%/mo, Sharpe 0.93
- **Contraction** (PMI <= 50): Mean return -0.22%/mo, Sharpe -0.12
- Regime difference: p = 0.019 (statistically significant)

This means ISM PMI is useful as a **contemporaneous regime indicator** but cannot be used
as a leading signal for trading.

## Academic and Professional Research

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| ISM PMI leads industrial production by 1-2 months | Federal Reserve | PMI leads real economy but not equities |
| Stock markets are forward-looking and price in PMI changes early | Fama (1981) | Equities anticipate PMI rather than react to it |
| PMI above 50 correlates with GDP growth | ISM Research | Strong macro signal for economic cycle positioning |
| New Orders sub-index is most predictive component | Stock & Watson | Sub-components may add value beyond headline PMI |
| ISM PMI is published before most hard economic data | BLS Calendar | Information advantage vs hard data but not vs markets |

## Limitations

1. **Not Predictive for Equities**: Stock market moves before PMI data is released
2. **Survey Bias**: Self-reported data from purchasing managers, not objective measurement
3. **Diffusion vs Magnitude**: PMI measures breadth (% reporting growth) not magnitude
4. **Manufacturing Focus**: Only ~12% of GDP is manufacturing; services dominate
5. **Market Pricing**: PMI is closely watched; moves may already be priced in
